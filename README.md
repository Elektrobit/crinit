# Crinit -- Configurable Rootfs Init


<img src="images/crinit-logo.png" width=20% height=20% align="right">

## In a Nutshell

Crinit is an init daemon executed as PID 1 by the Linux Kernel. It reads a global configuration ("series"-file) either
specified on the command line or from `/etc/crinit/default.series`. The series file in turn may reference further
configuration files or a whole directory from which all configs shall be loaded. Each one defines a task potentially
containing a set of commands and dependencies on other tasks.

The specified tasks are then started with as much parallelism as dependencies allow, i.e. tasks without any dependencies
are spawned as soon as possible after Crinit has been started. Once a task is spawned, finished, or has failed, its
dependent tasks are updated and spawned as necessary.

## Concept

The below diagram shows the overall concept of Crinit.

![Rootfs Init Daemon Components](images/rootfs_init_comp.svg)

Not indicated in the diagram are planned cryptographic features of the Config Parser intended to provide optional
verification/integrity checking of the global and task configurations.

## Features

Crinit currently has the following features implemented:

* starting of tasks with parallelism and dependency-resolution
    - tasks may have one or multiple commands, or none to form a dependency group
    - dependencies can be either on specific task state changes or on "features" another (unknown) task will provide
    - timestamping of creation, start, and end times of a task
* a C client API and a command-line interface using it (`crinit-ctl`) capable of
    - adding new tasks
    - managing (stop, kill, restart, ...) already loaded tasks
    - querying task status and timestamps
    - handling reboot and poweroff
    - a basic source-compatible implementation of `sd_notify()`
* task IO redirection (like shell pipes)
    - to files, for example for basic logging purposes
    - to named pipes, to pipe output between tasks
* task environment variable management
    - a global environment can be set
    - task-specific local settings can override and/or extend the global environment
* include files to maintain task configuration presets
* optional integration with [elos](https://github.com/Elektrobit/elos)
    - support for events sent by elos as task dependencies
* ability to report task state changes back to elos
    - emits appropriate events when a task is created, starts, exits, or fails
* optional signature checking of Crinit's configuration files

In the future we also plan to support:

* restriction of processes started/managed by Crinit
    - UID/GID, capabilities, cgroups,...

There are example configurations below which show how to use the currently implemented features.
For detailed explanations of Crinit's inner workings please refer to the Doxygen documentation generated during build.
The client API is documented in the Doxygen documentation of `crinit-client.h`. The API is implemented as a shared
library (`libcrinit-client.so`).

This repository also includes an example application to generate a `/etc/machine-id` file, which is used to uniquely
identify the system (for example by `elosd`). The `machine-id-gen` tool is supposed to be called on boot, for example
from `earlysetup.crinit` as shown in the example configuration files contained in this repository. Its implementation
either uses the value for `systemd.machine_id` given on the Kernel command line or -- on an NXP S32G-based board -- the
unique ID burned to on-chip OTP memory. If the Kernel command line value is set, it always takes precedence and any
physical memory OTP reads are omitted. This means that while the application has special functionality for S32G SoCs,
it can work on any target as long as the Kernel command line contains the necessary value.

# Details

## Configuration

As described above, Crinit needs a global series-file containing global configuration options as well as a list of task
configurations. Examples for a local demonstration inside the build environment (see [Build
Instructions](#Build Instructions) below) are available in `config/test/` and examples to use as a starting point for a
minimal system boot are available in `config/example/`.

The general format of crinit configuration files is INI-style `KEY = value` pairs. Some settings may be array-like,
meaning they can be specified multiple times to append values. Leaving out the `KEY =` part at the start of the line in
favor of at least one whitespace character is shorthand for appending to the last key, for example:
```
ARRAY_LIKE_KEY = value 1
ARRAY_LIKE_KEY = value 2
```
is equivalent to
```
ARRAY_LIKE_KEY = value 1
                 value 2
```

### Example Global Configuration

An example to boot a minimal environment may look like this:
```
# Crinit global configuration file

TASKS = earlysetup.crinit check_qemu.crinit network-dhcp.crinit
        sshd.crinit getty.crinit

TASKDIR = /etc/crinit
TASK_FILE_SUFFIX = .crinit
TASKDIR_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS = YES
INCLUDEDIR = /etc/crinit
INCLUDE_SUFFIX = .crincl
DEBUG = NO

SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD_US = 100000

USE_SYSLOG = NO
USE_ELOS = YES

ELOS_SERVER = 192.168.3.43
ELOS_PORT = 2342

ENV_SET = FOO "foo"
ENV_SET = FOO_BAZ "${FOO} baz"
ENV_SET = GREETING "Good morning!"
```
#### Explanation
- **TASKS** -- The task configurations to load. This is an optional setting. If not set, **TASKDIR** will be scanned for
               task configuration files. (*array-like*)
- **TASKDIR** -- Where to find the task configurations, will be prepended to the filenames in **TASKS**.
                 Default: `/etc/crinit`
- **TASK_FILE_SUFFIX** -- Filename suffix of task configurations. Only relevant if **TASKS** is not set.
                          Default: `.crinit`
- **TASKDIR_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS** -- If symbolic links should be followed during scanning of **TASKDIR**. Only relevant if
                                 **TASKS** is not set. Default: YES
- **INCLUDEDIR** -- Where to find include files referenced from task configurations. Default: Same as **TASKDIR**.
- **INCLUDE_SUFFIX** -- Filename suffix of include files referenced from task configurations. Default: `.crincl`
- **DEBUG** -- If crinit should be verbose in its output. Either `YES` or `NO`. Default: `NO`
- **SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD_US** -- The amount of microseconds to wait between `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL` on shutdown/reboot.
                                  Default: 100000
- **USE_SYSLOG** -- If syslog should be used for output if it is available. If set to `YES`, Crinit will switch to
                    syslog for output as soon as a task file `PROVIDES` the `syslog` feature. Ideally this should be
                    a task file loading a syslog server such as syslogd or elosd. Default: `NO`
- **USE_ELOS** -- If Elos should be used as event based dependency provider if it is available. If set to `YES`, Crinit will allow Elos event filters as
                  task dependency with the `@elos` prefix as soon as a task file `PROVIDES` the `elos` feature. Ideally this should be
                  a task file loading the Elos daemon elosd. Default: `NO`
- **ELOS_SERVER** -- Ip address of the elos server. Default: `127.0.0.1`
- **ELOS_PORT** -- Port of the elos server. Default: `54321`
- **ENV_SET** -- See section **Setting Environment Variables** below. (*array-like*)
- **FILTER_DEFINE** -- See section **Defining Elos Filters** below. (*array-like*)

### Example Task Configuration
The `network-dhcp.crinit` from above could for example look like this:
```
# DHCP config for a minimal system

NAME = network-dhcp

INCLUDE = daemon_env_preset

COMMAND = /bin/mkdir -p /var/lib/dhcpcd
          /bin/mount -t tmpfs none /var/lib/dhcpcd
          /bin/touch /var/lib/dhcpcd/resolv.conf
          /bin/mount -o bind /var/lib/dhcpcd/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
          /sbin/ifconfig lo up
          /sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
          /sbin/dhcpcd -j /var/log/dhcpcd.log eth0

DEPENDS = check_qemu:fail earlysetup:wait @provided:writable_var

PROVIDES = ipv4_dhcp:wait resolvconf:wait

RESPAWN = NO
RESPAWN_RETRIES = -1

ENV_SET = FOO_BAR "${FOO} bar"
          ESCAPED_VAR "Global variable name: \${FOO}"
          VAR_WITH_ESC_SEQUENCES "hex\t\x68\x65\x78"
          GREETING "Good evening!"

IO_REDIRECT = STDOUT "/var/log/net-dhcp.log" APPEND 0644
IO_REDIRECT = STDERR STDOUT
```
#### Explanation
- **NAME** -- The name given to this task configuration. Relevant if other tasks want to depend on this one. This is a
  mandatory setting.
- **INCLUDE** -- See section **Include files** below. (*array-like*)
- **COMMAND** -- The commands to be executed in series. Executable paths must be absolute. Execution will stop if
  one of them fails and the whole task will be considered failed. The whole task is considered finished (i.e.
  the `network-dhcp:wait` dependency is fulfilled) if the last command has successfully returned. If no **COMMAND** is
  given, the task is treated as a dependency group or "meta-task", see below. (*array-like*)
- **DEPENDS** -- A list of dependencies which need to be fulfilled before this task is considered "ready-to-start".
  Semantics are `<taskname>:{fail,wait,spawn}`, where `spawn` is fulfilled when (the first command of) a task has been
  started, `wait` if it has successfully completed, and `fail` if it has failed somewhere along the way. Here we can see
  this task is only run if and after the `earlysetup` (setup of system directories, etc.) has fully completed and the
  `check_qemu` task has determined we are _not_ running inside the emulator and therefore exited with an error code.
  This may be left out or explicitly set to empty using `""` which is interpreted as "no dependencies".
  There is also the special `@provided:feature` syntax where we can define we want to depend on a specific feature
  another task may implement (see **PROVIDES**). In this case `@provided:writable_var` could mean that another task
  may have mounted a tmpfs or a writable partition there which we need for the first `mkdir`. That task would need to
  advertise the `writable_var` feature in its `PROVIDES` config value. (*array-like*)
  Additionally there is an optional feature that allows tasks to be started based on system events issued by elos.
  Tasks depending on an elos event can use the `@elos:<filter_name>` syntax to specify a task dependency that is fullfilled
  as soon as the specified elos filter triggers. The filters themself can be specified using the **FILTER_DEFINE** keyword.
- **PROVIDES** -- As we have seen above, a task may depend on features and also provide them. In this case we advertise
  that after completion of this task (`wait`), the features `ipv4_dhcp` and `resolvconf` are provided. Another task may
  then depend e.g. on `@provided:resolvconf`. While the feature names chosen here reflect the functional intention, they
  can be chosen arbitrarily. (*array-like*)
- **RESPAWN** -- If set to `YES`, the task will be restarted on failure or completion. Useful for daemons like `getty`.
  Default: `NO`
- **RESPAWN_RETRIES** -- Number of times a respawned task may fail *in a row* before it is not started again. The
  special value `-1` is interpreted as "unlimited". Default: -1
- **ENV_SET** -- See section **Setting Environment Variables** below. (*array-like*)
- **FILTER_DEFINE** -- See section **Defining Elos Filters** below. (*array-like*)
- **IO_REDIRECT** -- See section **IO Redirections** below. (*array-like*)

### Setting Environment Variables

Crinit supports setting environment variables in the global and task configurations as shown above. The variables in the
global config are valid for all tasks and may be locally overriden or referenced. The above examples together would
result in the following list of environment variables for the task `network-dhcp` (with explanatory comments).

```
FOO=foo
FOO_BAZ=foo baz                            # Expansion of variable set before in the same config.
FOO_BAR=foo bar                            # Expansion of global variable in task-local variable.
GREETING=Good evening!                     # Override of global variable.
ESCAPED_VAR=Global variable name: ${FOO}   # Avoid variable expansion through escaping.
VAR_WITH_ESC_SEQUENCES=hex  hex            # Support for escape sequences including hexadecimal bytes.
```

### Defining Elos Filters

Crinit supports an optional feature, which enables a task to depend on specific system events issued by the elos event logger.
In order to depend on elos events, a task uses the `@elos` dependency prefix in conjunction with a elos filter name. The corresponding
filter has to be defined within the task itself or within the global environment. The definition follows the syntax of normal
environment variables, but uses the `FILTER_DEFINE` prefix instead:

```
FILTER_DEFINE = <filter_name> <filter_rule>
```

For example:

```
NAME = elos_ssh_event_task
COMMAND = /bin/echo "Event task has been run."

FILTER_DEFINE = SSHD_FILTER ".event.source.appName 'sshd' STRCMP"

DEPENDS = @elos:SSHD_FILTER
```

#### Ruleset

* A configuration file may have an unlimited number of `ENV_SET` statements, each specifying a single environment
  variable.
* `ENV_SET` statements must be of the form `ENV_SET = VARIABLE_NAME "variable content"`. The quotes around the variable
  content are mandatory and will not appear in the environment variable itself.
* Setting the same variable twice overrides the first instance.
* Variables can be referenced/expanded using shell-like `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax.
    + Expansion can be avoided by escaping with a `\`.
* Variables can reference all other variables set before it, globally and locally.
* Variables are set/processed in the order they appear in the config file.
* Common escape sequences are supported: `\a, \b, \n, \t, \$, \\, \x<two digit hex number>`.

### Include files

A crinit task configuration may reference multiple include files at any point in the task file. The effect is the same
as manually copying the contents of the include file at exactly that point in the task config, similar to C includes.
Additionally, it is possible to define an import list if not all settings in the include file should be applied.

An INCLUDE statement looks like
```
INCLUDE = <include_name> [list,of,imported,settings]
```
where `<include_name>` is the filename of the include without the ending and without the leading path. The imported
settings are defined as a comma-separated list of possible configuration options. If omitted, everything in the include
file is taken.

Currently only `IO_REDIRECT`, `DEPENDS`, and `ENV_SET` are supported in include files.

Example:
```
INCLUDE = server_settings ENV_SET,IO_REDIRECT
```
Imports only the `ENV_SET` and `IO_REDIRECT` settings from (assuming default values for include dir and suffix)
`/etc/crinit/server_settings.crincl`.

`server_settings.crincl` could look like
```
ENV_SET = HTTP_PORT "8080"
IO_REDIRECT = STDOUT /some/file.txt
IO_REDIRECT = STDERR STDOUT
DEPENDS = @provided:network
```
In the above case, the DEPENDS setting would be ignored.

### IO Redirections

Crinit supports per-task IO redirection to/from file and between STDOUT/IN/ERR using `IO_REDIRECT` statements in the
task configurations. The statements are of the form
```
<REDIRECT_FROM> <REDIRECT_TO> [ APPEND | TRUNCATE | PIPE ] [ OCTAL_MODE ]
```
Where `REDIRECT_FROM` is one of `{ STDOUT, STDERR, STDIN }`, and `REDIRECT_TO` may either also be one of those streams
or an absolute path to a file. `APPEND` or `TRUNCATE` signify whether an existing file at that location should be
appended to or truncated. Default is `TRUNCATE`. The special value `PIPE` is discussed below (see *Named Pipes*).
`OCTAL_MODE` sets the permission bits if the file is newly created. Default is `0644`.

Accordingly the statements in the example configuration above will result in `stdout` being redirected to the file
`/var/log/net-dhcp.log` in append mode. If the file does not yet exist, it will be created with permission bits `0644`.
The second statement then redirects stderr to stdout, capturing both in the log.

Other examples could be
```
IO_REDIRECT = STDERR "/var/log/err.log" APPEND
IO_REDIRECT = STDOUT "/dev/null"
```
to silence stdout and log stderr, or
```
IO_REDIRECT = STDIN /opt/data/backup.tar
IO_REDIRECT = STDOUT /opt/data/backup.tar.gz
```
to read stdin from file and capture stdout to another file. Stderr will go to console as normal.

#### Named pipes

As indicated above, `crinit` also accepts the setting `PIPE` instead of `APPEND` or `TRUNCATE`. With this setting,
`crinit` will ensure that the given path is a named pipe (also called a FIFO special file). This is useful to pipe the
output of one task to another.

A common example would be redirection of output to syslog. For that we would create two task files, one as the sender
and another as the receiver (using the `logger` utility provided by e.g. busybox and others).

**Sending Task**

```
NAME = some_task

COMMAND = /bin/echo "This output will be redirected to syslog!"
RESPAWN = NO
DEPENDS = ""

IO_REDIRECT = STDOUT "/tmp/some_task_log_pipe" PIPE 0640
```

**Receiving Task**

```
NAME = some_task_logger

COMMAND = /usr/bin/logger -t some_task
RESPAWN = YES
DEPENDS = ""

IO_REDIRECT = STDIN "/tmp/some_task_log_pipe" PIPE 0640
```

This will redirect the output of the `echo` command to the input of the `logger` utility and thereby to syslog. As is
shown, it is also possible to set permissions for named pipes (default will also be `0644`). It should be kept in mind
to keep the permissions the same in both tasks. Setting different permissions in the sending and receiving task of a
pipe creates a race condition where one of the tasks will be able to create the named pipe with its settings. The other
task will take it as-is, as long as it can access the file.

#### A note on buffering

By default, glibc will switch from line- to block-buffered mode when redirecting a stream to file. This may make it
hard to use e.g. `tail -f ...` to monitor the output in parallel. To get around that problem, one may use the `stdbuf`
utility (part of GNU coreutils).

In a `crinit` task, the following
```
NAME = line_buffered_task

COMMAND = /usr/bin/stdbuf -oL -eL <SOME_EXECUTABLE>

IO_REDIRECT = STDOUT "/some/where.txt"
              STDERR "/some/where/else.txt"
```

will result in line-buffered output to the files which can be monitored easily. For more details, see the `stdbuf` man
page.

### Dependency groups (meta-tasks)

A dependency group or meta-task is a task without any **COMMAND**s. The provided dependencies of the meta-task will be
fulfilled immediately once its own dependencies are fulfilled. This can be used to semantically combine different
dependencies into one. Reasons to do that can be semantic readability of the configs or to provide hook dependencies
for third-party applications having an opaque view of their target system.

As an example a dependency group and a task using it could look like

```
NAME = dep_grp_server

DEPENDS = @provided:sql-db @provided:network @provided:firewall-open-port httpd:spawn

PROVIDES = server:wait
```

```
NAME = local_http_client

COMMAND = /usr/bin/some-http-request localhost

DEPENDS = @provided:server
# or, with same effect: DEPENDS = dep_grp_server:wait
```

Semantically, this would mean `local_http_client` only cares about the server, as a singular entity, being set up and
running. This could also be delivered by a third party with only the interface knowledge "You need to wait for the
`server` dependency". How to provide this dependency, with which tasks, and in what order is then up to the system
integrator who maintains `dep_grp_server`.

### Configuration Signatures

If compiled in (see Build Instructions), Crinit supports checking signatures of its task and global configuration files.
The algorithm used is RSA-PSS using 4096 Bit keys and SHA256 hashing.

Crinit will use a root public key (named `crinit-root` as the searchable key description`) stored in the Kernel user
keyring and optionally downstream signed public keys stored in the rootfs. The downstream keys need to be signed using
the root key. Configuration files must then be signed either by the root key or by one of the downstream keys.

The root public key must be enrolled to the user keyring before Crinit starts. A common solution is to do this from a
signed initramfs, thereby leveraging a secure boot chain to establish trust in the key.

Signature checking is configured via the Kernel command line (also part of the trusted/secure boot chain) using these
two settings:

* `crinit.signatures={yes, no}` - Activates signature checking if set to `yes`. Default is `no`.
* `crinit.sigkeydir=<path_to_downstream_keys>` - Sets the path where Crinit searches for signed public keys in the
       rootfs. Default is `/etc/crinit/pk`.

For downstream keys and configuration files, Crinit expects a corresponding signature file with the `.sig` suffix to be
present in the same directory. As an example, the task file `very_valid.task` would need a signature file
`very_valid.task.sig` next to it. Key files may be in DER and PEM format with the appropriate filename extensions.
The `crinit-root` public key stored in the user keyring should be in DER binary format.

To prepare a system for using signatures and correctly signing files, the `scripts` directory contains

* **crinit-genkeys.sh** to generate private signing keys and their public key counterparts.
```
Usage: ./crinit-genkeys.sh [-h/--help] [-k/--key-file <KEY_FILE>] [-o/--output <OUTPUT_FILE>]
  If no other arguments are given, will generate an RSA-4096 private key. Alternatively using '-k', you can obtain
  the public key for the given private key.
    -h/--help
        - Show this help.
    -f/--format
        - Choose the format of the output file. Must be either 'pem' or 'der'. Default: 'pem'
    -k/--key-file <KEY_FILE>
        - Generate a public key from the given private key. Use '-' for Standard Input. Default: Generate a private key.
    -o/--output <OUTPUT_FILE>
        - The filename of the output key. Default: write to Standard Output
```

* **crinit-sign.sh** to sign files with a given private key.
```
Usage: ./crinit-sign.sh [-h/--help] [-k/--key-file <KEY_FILE>] [-o/--output <OUTPUT_FILE>] [<INPUT_FILE>]
  Will sign given input data with an RSA-PSS signature from an RSA-4096 private key using a SHA-256 hash.
    -h/--help
        - Show this help.
    -k/--key-file <KEY_FILE>
        - Use the given private key to sign. Must have been created using crinit-genkeys.sh. (Mandatory)
    -o/--output <OUTPUT_FILE>
        - Write signature to OUTPUT_FILE. Default: Standard Output
    <INPUT_FILE>
        - Positional argument. The input data to sign. Default: Standard Input
```
Step by step instruction for a system with a root key and one downstream key would be:

1. `$ crinit-genkeys.sh -o crinit-root-priv.pem         # generate private root key`
2. `$ crinit-genkeys.sh -f der -k crinit-root-pub.der   # calculate public root key from it (destined for user keyring)`
3. `$ crinit-genkeys.sh -o crinit-dwstr-priv.pem        # generate downstream key`
4. `$ crinit-genkeys.sh -k crinit-root-pub.pem          # calculate public key from it (destined for rootfs)`
5. `$ crinit-sign.sh -k crinit-root-priv.pem -o crinit-dwstr-pub.pem.sig crinit-dwstr-pub.pem  # sign downstream key with root key`
6. Do step 5 for all configuration files crinit is expected to parse using either the root or the downstream key.

## crinit-ctl Usage Info

`crinit-ctl` is a CLI control program for `crinit` wrapping the client API functionality.

Below is its help output:
```
USAGE: crinit-ctl <ACTION> [OPTIONS] <PARAMETER> [PARAMETERS...]

               represent the times the task was Created (loaded/parsed), last Started (became running), and
               last Ended (failed or is done). If the event has not occurred yet, the timestamp's value will
               be 'n/a'.
      notify <TASK_NAME> <"SD_NOTIFY_STRING">
             - Will send an sd_notify-style status report to Crinit. Only MAINPID and READY are
               implemented. See the sd_notify documentation for their meaning.
        list
             - Print the list of loaded tasks and their status.
      reboot
             - Will request Crinit to perform a graceful system reboot. crinit-ctl can be symlinked to
               reboot as a shortcut which will invoke this command automatically.
    poweroff
             - Will request Crinit to perform a graceful system shutdown. crinit-ctl can be symlinked to
               poweroff as a shortcut which will invoke this command automatically.
  General Options:
        --verbose/-v - Be verbose.
        --help/-h    - Print this help.
        --version/-V - Print version information about crinit-ctl, the crinit-client library,
                       and -- if connection is successful -- the crinit daemon.
```

## Smart bash completion for crinit-ctl

There is a script to support smart bash completions for the crinit-ctl executable located at
`completion/crinit-ctl.bash`. On modern distributions, this file will need to be copied and renamed to
`/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/crinit-ctl` to be picked up automatically. The `cmake` installer can do this
(see below). Note that a fully bash-compatible shell (`bash`,`dash`) is required to take advantage of this.

For testing purposes, it is sufficient to run `source completion/crinit-ctl.bash` to activate the smart completion for
the current session. The script can also be sourced from `.bashrc` if a system-wide installation is not desired.

Once installed and loaded, `crinit-ctl <TAB><TAB>` will show/complete available command verbs like `addtask`, `enable`,
`disable`, etc. For `crinit-ctl addtask <TAB><TAB>`, paths to `\*.crinit` files and specific options will be completed,
similar for `addseries`. Verbs taking a task name as input will have completion of available tasks loaded by crinit.
The script calls `crinit-ctl list` and parses its output in the background to achieve this.

## Build Instructions
Executing
```
ci/docker-run.sh
```
will start a Docker container for the native host architecture with all necessary programs to build Crinit and its
Doxygen documentation and to run a short local demonstration.

It is possible to run the Docker container for a foreign architecture such as arm64 with the help of qemu-user-static
and binfmt-support. Make sure these packages are installed on your host system if you want to use this functionality.
All following commands to be run inside the container will be the same regardless of the architecture.
```
ci/docker-run.sh arm64
```

By default, `ci/docker-run.sh` will use a container based on Ubuntu Jammy. If another version is desired, it can be
specified as a second parameter. For example, you can run a Lunar-based container using
```
ci/docker-run.sh amd64 lunar
```

Inside the container, it is sufficient to run
```
ci/build.sh
```
which will compile the release configuration for `crinit`, the client library and crinit-ctl as well as a suite of RPMs.
The doxygen documentation is built as well. The script will copy relevant build artifacts to `result/`.

For debugging purposes, the debug configuration can be built with the following command. Optionally it is also possible
to enable AddressSanitizer (ASAN) for additional runtime checks or static analysis using `-fanalyzer` at compile-time.
```
ci/build.sh Debug --asan --analyzer
```

Afterwards, it is possible to run (also inside the container)
```
ci/demo.sh
```
for a short local demonstration of `crinit`'s client API using `crinit-ctl`.

A `clang-tidy` analysis of the source can be performed using
```
ci/clang-tidy.sh
```
This will also generate a `compile_commands.json`. The output will be saved to `result/clang-tidy`.

Unit tests or smoke tests can be run using the respective commands below. For the debug configuration, either of them
takes an additional `Debug` argument.
```
ci/run-utest.sh
ci/run-smoketests.sh
```

In order to run integration tests, you can use `ci/run-integration-tests.sh`. This will set up two docker containers,
one for the Robot test framework and one that runs Crinit and Elos, and executes all integration tests inside the robot
container.

```
ci/run-integration-tests.sh
```

You can also manually start both containers with `ci/docker-target-run.sh` and `ci/docker-integration-run.sh`.
Adapt the configuration within the robot container by changing the ip address of the target container within the robot
variables (`test/integration/robot_variables.py`) to the current ip of the target container and run the tests by
executing `test/integration/scripts/run-integration-tests.sh` inside the robot container.

If a manual test build is desired, running the following command sequence
inside the container will setup the build system and build native binaries.
```
mkdir -p build/amd64
cmake -B build/amd64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=On -DUNIT_TESTS=On
make -C build/amd64
```

The cmake setup supports some optional features:
* Crinit signature support using `-DENABLE_SIGNATURE_SUPPORT={On, Off}`. If set to on, crinit will have a dependency to
  [libmbedtls](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls). Default is `On`.
* Unit tests using `-DUNIT_TESTS={On, Off}`. If set to on, Crinit's unit tests will be built and installed to
  `UNIT_TEST_INSTALL_DIR`. This will cause a dependency to cmocka 1.1.5 or greater. Default is `On` with installation
  path `${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/test/crinit/utest`.
* Build and install API documentation in doxygen HTML format using `-DAPI_DOC={On, Off}`. Needs doxygen. Default is
  `On`.
* Build and install an example generator for the machine id file (see above) using `-DMACHINE_ID_EXAMPLE={On, Off}`.
  Default is `Off`.
* Install the example configurations from `config/example` to `/etc/${EXAMPLE_TASKDIR}`. Default is `Off`, default
  installation path is `/etc/crinit/example`.
* Install the smoke test scripts and configurations, using `-DINSTALL_SMOKE_TESTS={On, Off}`, to the
  `SMOKE_TEST_SCRIPT_DIR` and `SMOKE_TEST_CONF_DIR`, respectively. Default is `Off` and default installation paths are
  `${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/test/crinit/smoketest` and `${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/test/crinit/smoketest/config`.
* Install the necessary resources for a robot test target system using `-DINSTALL_ROBOT_TEST_RESOURCES={On, Off}` to
  `ROBOT_TEST_RESOURCE_DIR`. Default is `Off` and default install path is `${CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR}/crinit/itest`.
* Set the installation path for the symbolic links for `reboot` and `poweroff` using `PWR_SYMLINKS_PATH`. Default is
  `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${CMAKE_INSTALL_SBINDIR}`
* Install the bash completion script for crinit-ctl, using `-DINSTALL_BASH_COMPLETION={On, Off}`, to the
  `BASH_COMPLETION_DIR`. Default is `On` and default isntall path is
   `${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR/bash-completion/completions`.
