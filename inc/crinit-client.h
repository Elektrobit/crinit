 * the environment will not be unset. If \a unset_environment is not 0, a warning will be printed.
 *
 * READY=1 lets Crinit know the task is currently running. MAINPID=[pid] tells Crinit its PID. Delimiting character is a
 * newline.
 *
 * Example: `"READY=1\nMAINPID=42"` will update the task's state to #EBCL_TASK_STATE_RUNNING and its PID to 42.

 * For more information regarding the use cases of this interface, refer to the official SD_NOTIFY documentation.
