Architecture Design Records
===========================

During the development of crinit, many decisions have to be made. This chapter
provides a place to collect new ideas and discuss them until we are able to
agree on a final decision of an topic.


An *Architecture Design Record* (**ADR**) should follow roughly the pattern

* Problem Description
* Influencing factors
* Assumptions
* Considered Alternatives
* Decision
   * Rationale
   * Open Points

There is an :doc:`ADR template<ADR_template>` which can be used as a starting
point.
